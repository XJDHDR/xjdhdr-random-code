These files are filter lists for Adblock Plus or an adblocker that is compatible with ABP filter lists.

The file "My-list" is my personal list of website filters that I use. They mainly consist of pro-piracy and/or anti-Christian websites.

"Google-Filters" consists of filters that are aimed at blocking ads and tracking originating from Google's websites and servers.

If you want to use block Google's ads and tracking and also want to use ABP's Acceptable Ads feature, you should disable the option to use Acceptable Ads in ABP's options and instead subscribe to my "Acceptable-ads-without-Google" filter list. The reason is because the Acceptable Ads filter list contains some entries that unblocks Google's ads on some websites. Hence, using the "Google-Filters" list in conjunction with the default Acceptable Ads feature will result in some Google ads not being blocked. To fix this, my "Acceptable-ads-without-Google" list is the default Acceptable Ads list with all entries related to Google stripped out.

Finally, the "hphosts-*" files are hosts files copied from hosts-file.net and converted into ABP compatible filters. The 3 letters at the end indicate the classification given to the websites in that list. The classifications can be found here: http://hosts-file.net/?s=classifications

I will try to update these filter lists twice a day though this might sometimes not happen due to technical difficulties.
