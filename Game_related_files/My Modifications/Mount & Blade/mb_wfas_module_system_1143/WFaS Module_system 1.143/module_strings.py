# Retirement Texts: s7=village name; s8=castle name; s9=town name
  ("retirement_text_1", "Only too late do you realize that your money cannot last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save, and you fare poorly in several desperate attempts to go forth adventuring again. You end up a beggar in {s9}, living on alms and the charity of the church."),
  ("retirement_text_2", "Only too late do you realize that your money cannot last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save. Once every thaler has evaporated from your hands, you are reduced to a life of crime in the backstreets of {s9}, using your grim skills to eke out a living, robbing coppers from women and the poor townsmen."),
  ("retirement_text_3", "Only too late do you realize that your money cannot last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save, and you end up a penniless, drifting from tavern to tavern, begging drinks from indulgent patrons, regaling them with war stories that no one ever believes."),
  ("retirement_text_4", "The silver you've saved doesn't last long, but you manage to put together enough to buy some land near the village of {s7}. There you become a free farmer, and you soon begin to attract potential {wives/husbands}. In time, the villagers come to treat you as their local hero. You always receive a place of honor at feasts, and your exploits are told and retold in the pubs and taverns, that the young may keep a memory of you ever after."),
  ("retirement_text_5", "The silver you've saved does not last long, but it is enough to buy a small tavern in {s9}. Although the locals are wary of you at first, they soon come to accept you, and in time, your growing tavern becomes a popular feast hall and meeting place. People come for miles to eat or stay there, and you are renown for the epic stories you tell of your adventuring days."),
  ("retirement_text_6", "You have saved wisely throughout your career, and now your silver, and your intelligence, allow you to make some excellent investments to cement your future. After buying several shops and warehouses in {s9}, your shrewdness turns you into one of the most prominent merchants in town, and you soon become a wealthy {man/woman} known as much for your trading empire as your former military exploits."),
  ("retirement_text_7", "As a landed noble, however minor, your future is all but assured. You settle in your hold at {s7}, administrating the village and fields, adjudicating the local courts and fulfilling your obligations to your lord. Occasionally your lord calls you to muster and command in his campaigns, but these stints are brief, and you never truly return to the adventuring days of your youth. You have already made your fortune, and with your own hall and holdings, you've few wants that your personal wealth and the income of your lands cannot afford you."),
  ("retirement_text_8", "There is no question that you have done very well for yourself indeed. Your extensive holdings and the wealth you accumulated in your adventures are enough to guarantee a rich and easy life for the rest of your days. Retiring to your noble seat in {s8}, you exchange adventure for politics, and you soon establish yourself as a considerable power in your nation's royal court. When you are not busied with political intrigue, you hunt your private forests, feast in your hall, and tell your hundreds of fine war stories to your guests. You have little trouble making the best of the years that follow."),
  ("retirement_text_9", "As a reward for your competent and loyal service, your lord decrees that you be given a hereditary title, which places you firmly among the major nobility of the realm. You are invested as baron of {s7}, and become one of your lord's closest advisors. Your renown garners much subtle influence and significant command. You spend your days playing the games of power, administering your great fiefs, and recounting the old days of adventure and glory."),
  ("retirement_text_10", "Though you started from humble beginnings, your lord holds you in high esteem, and but a small ripple of surprise passes through the realm when he names you to the hereditary title of {Count/Countess} of {s9}. Vast fiefs and fortunes are now yours to command. You quickly become your lord's most trusted advisor, almost his equal, and charged with much of the running of his realm. You sit upon a throne in your own splendorous palace, as one of the most powerful figures in the nation."),

These legends and tales have become the bane of our family. The descendants of Dracula left Trasylvania, and I grew up in Kamenets, near the border. For a while now I have lived the life of a wanderer. It is not the life I would have chosen..."),
  ("npc3_backstory_b", "I am the priest Spasokukotsky. The bishop of Riga gave me a small village parish, but within the week he sent his sacrist there to check how well I was fulfilling my duties. After the Sunday mass this bore came to my humble cell. First he inquired what a parish woman was doing in my bed, and then had the gall to start preaching to me. He explained that one should not spin the censer over one's head during the sermon -- and I endured his condescension well enough. He said that prayers should be concluded by the word ""Amen"", and not by the word I spoke at the end, and still I remained silent. The parish loved my way of doing things, you understand! But then, when he began to shout that he saw goods from my Church being sold at the Riga market, I could no longer stand it any longer, and beat him with a staff so hard he barely made it out alive."),
  ("npc4_backstory_b", "During the battle of Berestechek, when the Poles and Crimeans crushed Hmelnitski's forces utterly, I was captured by the Tatars. They brought me to Kafa, offered me a place as a mercenary for the Turkish Sultan. But instead I killed the guards and fled."),
  ("npc5_backstory_b", "I served in the musket regiment of General Lennart Torstenson's, the finest commander in all of Sweden. I took part in the battle of Jankau, where we utterly defeated the very best of the German forces! Ah, those were the days!"),
  ("npc6_backstory_b", "My service went well, or would have, were it not for one Secret Department clerk. A skinny, wall-eyed fellow with a goatee, but he had set his sights on my wife. The foul creature knew that she was faithful to me, but he devised a dirty trick using the powers that came with his position. He whispered to the chief hunting clerk that I boasted in front of men that I saw a wondrous horse in the woods, that had a horn on its head. Our sire is quite keen on various rare animals, and so I was entrusted with the task of capturing this creature -- or get fired and thrown into the gaol for my idle talk."),

  ("npc9_backstory_b", "My ancestor received his title from the Grand Prince Algirdas at the end of the XIV century. For military valor he were granted vast lands near the town of Bryansk. Since that day all the eldest sons in our family bear his name. Our house served the Grand Duchy of Lithuania faithfully for three centuries, while our borderlands were always an apple of discord between Lithuania and Moscow. Our estate slowly fell into decay, yet we still remained their masters. However, recently the Moscow Tsar gave it to one of his nobles."),

You cannot imagine how deeply it offends me to see the low-born Giray ruling the Crimean Khanate! I even have pay them a tribute! -- What an insult!"),
  ("npc12_backstory_b", "The Frenchman was certainly talkative. While I was treating him... my what stories he told! About cherry-trees under Pereyaslav which would grow only up to the waist, and of the crayfish in the Ukrainian rivers nigh the size of a cat! And that the Tatar children are born blind like puppies, and only open their eyes on the second week... Among other stories, Beauplan told me that the Sich Cossacks treat fever by mixing vodka with gunpowder..."),

  ("npc14_backstory_b", "My name is Ingri, and I hail from Reval. If you need provisions for amazing prices, or you wish to sell your merchandise at triple the standard prices, then I am your woman! I provided all the food and wine for the court regiment of Carl Gustaf himself -- and everyone was perfectly content with me. Except my competitors, of course! And one day those bastards changed one of my beer barrels, and my clients were treated to horse piss instead of beer -- on the King's birthday no less! Bad luck all around, what can one say. Now I have no patent, and no savings either. Free as a bird, like it or not."),
  ("npc15_backstory_b", "After he developed a passion for mead, my late husband began to beat me. Often he would come home blind drunk, and then go right for the belt... Well, one day I couldn't take it any longer. When he appeared, I was busy with dough in the kitchen, working my tired hands... So I gave him a blow on top of his head with my rolling-pin -- and broke his skull. "),
  ("npc16_backstory_b", "I was born in Kafa. When I reached the age of fourteen, I was taken from my parents, brought to Istanbul and trained as a guard. At eighteen, I became the bodyguard of the Sultan's beloved wife. Yet soon my charge must have somehow offended the master. The eunuchs strangled her. After that, I was returned to Kafa. Not to my home, though -- to the slave market, where I was sold."),

  ("npc2_backstory_c", "Several years ago, Hmelnitski's army laid siege to Kamenets. Soon a plague hit the Cossack camp, and they withdrew. But the same dreadful epidemic took the lives of many townsmen, including my parents. I volunteered to be the captain of the town guard, and could only visit their graves after sunset, so busy was I. The graveyard keeper spoke of it in a pub, and invented a few tall tales involving grave digging. The merchants, their minds inflamed by the war and the plague, accused me of mortal sins, and bent themselves on my destruction. All I could take as I fled the city were my sword and a treatise on the art of war."),
  ("npc3_backstory_c", "Learning of this, the bishop sent a mercenary band to deal with me. I did not wait for them to come, but took my belongings and fled to the woods. Soon I found out I had been defrocked and excommunicated by the bishop."),

And the tale that I sold my halberd to a trader is but a blatant lie! I mean, I can recall no such thing... Morning come, and word of it came to the regiment commander, and he relieved me of my soldier's patent. Yet I have not abandoned hope to re-enlist. I already prepared a petition, which I shall personally deliver to King Karl. However, the quarters of our august monarch moves with the army, and I squandered almost all my savings chasing after it."),
  ("npc6_backstory_c", "There was nothing I could do... My fate was to end up in a jail, and my wife would go straight into that clerk's bedroom. So I took my grandfather's pole-axe, went to the clerk's homestead and put him down like a pig. And my wife, Nastasia, I sent away in secret to Astrakhan, to distant relatives."),

He decided that the executioner needs no assistant, so I was put out of the palace the very same day. Now I make my bread as I can. Working as an assistant in the butcher's row at the markets, chopping up the carcass at the slaughterhouse. I even went as low as accepting a job killing a pig at a Cossack homestead -- for ten thaler! Shaitan damn that beast, cursed by the Allah..."),

Three months went by in an instant. But then my money ran out, and the master put me out of the mansion -- and the pani quickly went off with a fur trader who was happening by."),

The poor chap guzzled down the cure, and cried out like mad -- for the whole day, until he died in the evening. The nitre in the powder had burned his intestines.^The people of Kurenevka learned of this, and sent almost a full regiment after me, threatening to put my skin on a drum."),
  ("npc13_backstory_c", "As for me, I come from Poltava. My life would have been all right, save for that unfortunate cattle plague last Autumn. The local priest had long nursed a grudge against me -- suspected that I was stealing his parish from him, or some such nonsense. Accused me of witchcraft, and said it was I who killed the cattle. That very night they tarred and burned my house. Thankfully, some kind souls warned me in time, and I escaped with my life."),

They can weaken the enemy by shooting, and then destroy them in melee combat. However, the Reiters are inferior in skill to both professional shooters and 'true' heavy cavalry.^Reiter regiments comprise up to 2000 cavalrymen, with one squadron equipped with lances and the rest with pistols. Like waves, ranks of Reiters gallop towards the enemy and overwhelm them by pistol fire. "),
  ("quick_battle_troop_2", "These unique Polish horsemen are likely the finest heavy cavalry to have ever trodden the earth. Drawn from the brave Polish gentry, the swift hussars boast the finest equipment and military training of the time. The mere sight of these heavily armored warriors charging on their mighty horses would often be enough to inspire panic in the enemy ranks, and break the line of any troops still holding their ground. Nevertheless the hussars should avoid large groups of shooters, especially on a difficult terrain. The hussars' greatest moment of glory came in the battle at Vienna, where they held back the Turkish invasion of Europe. ^In the 17th century, the hussars were considered the best cavalry in the world. "),
  ("quick_battle_troop_3", "In these perfectly trained and equipped Boyars, all the might of western cavalry is combined with the speed of the east. Certain Europeans may call the Boyars a relic of feudalism, but none would say this to their face! ^The Boyars were the hereditary feudal elite of Russia from the 10th all the way through the 17th century. The Boyar class was highest among service class people, entitled not only to sit in the Boyar dumb, but to hold the highest status in it. However, the abolition of Mestnichestvo (the feudal hierarchical system of the time) in 1682 seriously undermined the power of the Boyars, and the Boyar title was eliminated by Peter the Great at the beginning of the 17th century. "),
  ("quick_battle_troop_4", "The cuirassiers (from the French word cuirass, armor) are a cavalry corps equipped with light chest armor, the cuirass. They developed in the 16th century in many European countries, and were designed to compensate for the dearth of knights in heavy cavalry. The cuirassiers' suite of armor (called 'cuirass armor') was reduced to a half-armor piece which was relatively inexpensive. By the 16th century, it consisted only of a helmet and a cuirass proper. Initially, when cuirassiers fought alongside knights, they wielded the same type of sword, but later they switched to using broadswords, and in certain armies, heavy sabers."),
  ("quick_battle_troop_5", "The bulk of the Tatar host were the jasaqs. Though average warriors, they posed a serious threat to the enemy because of their sheer numbers and their maneuverability. The jasaqs fight with a good bow and a saber of mediocre quality. The jasaqs are formidable archers, and are most effective in sidelong attacks. "),
  ("quick_battle_troop_6", "Musketeers form the core of any army. Their shooting skills make their presence on the battlefield decisive, as the tide of battle may be turned by a single musket salvo. However, in melee musketeers are extremely weak against cavalry or heavy infantry, and therefore must be protected by cavalry units or pikemen.^By the middle of the 16th century, most wars were fought with muskets, a weapon far more effective than its long-range predecessors, specifically the bow and the crossbow. An average person could learn to use the musket fairly quickly. The majority of low-rank musketeers were drawn from townsmen and peasants."),
  ("quick_battle_troop_7", "The netyagi proved themselves to be an admirable force. Their bravery and fighting spirit compensated for their lack of armor. While a pistol salvo at close range often guarantees their success, the netyagi can be easily trampled by cavalry. Naval campaigns, which were in essence pirate raids, were not unusual for Cossacks, and such sea voyages called for a new type of troops. Landing on an enemy shore was not always a bloodless affair, and merchant vessels were hardly defenseless either. The netyagi were first used on such sea raids. They would suffer heavy casualties as they leapt from the deck onto dry land or enemy ships, with no heavy armor to protect them or time to regroup and launch an attack. Netyagi were likewise employed in strictly land-based warfare, where they served as shock troops, the first to make contact with the enemy and to withstand the initial onslaught."),
  ("quick_battle_troop_8", "These fully armored and well-trained warriors fight with two-handed swords. Heavy infantry forces are by design placed in the front ranks, with the objective of breaking the enemy line. It is crucial to protect these warriors from enemy volleys, while in melee they can take care of themselves!"),
  ("quick_battle_troop_9", "From the second half of the 16th century to the beginning of the 17th, the obsolete free lances were replaced by a new type of troop -- the Rondartschiere. They wore a cuirass and carried a sword and a small round shield. A highly disciplined corps, the Rondartschiere were effective in melee, against both infantry and light cavalry. On the other hand, the Rondartschiere would scarcely be able to stand against musketeers or heavy cavalry. Gradually, this type of infantry declined, due to the rapid development of firearms and the overall shift from close- to long-range combat. Pikemen, however, remained active, and in certain countries were employed into the beginning of the 19th century."),
  ("quick_battle_troop_10", "Pikemen were a key part of European armies for a very long time. While firearms developed, armor was developing as well, and becoming lighter. Eventually, pikemen went into battle wearing only a cuirass to protect them from edged weapons, and a helmet to cover their heads. Pikemen wielded long pikes, hence the name. They fought in a close formation, and were designed to safeguard the musketeers from the attacks of enemy cavalry. ^Firearms were still far from perfect. As a rule, after one salvo, musketeers would either meet the enemy in hand-to-hand combat or exchange position with a back rank which had not yet taken a shot. In such circumstances, some infantry corps had to be equipped with armor and cold steel for close-range combat. Some armies employed pikemen into the beginning of the 19th century. "),
  ("quick_battle_troop_11", "Fierce Scottish warriors were notorious all across Europe. Since the times of Edward III and William Wallace's revolt, Scottish pikemen had been famous for breaking English cavalry. Scottish halberdiers kept alive the glorious traditions of German free lancers and Swedish pikemen. This type of infantry dominated the field In the 15th and 16th centuries, and was still well in demand until the 17th century. Halberdiers successfully countered enemy cavalry and, due to the imperfections of ranged weapons, were able to withstand the onslaught of enemy infantry. "),

Where it fell they set up a pagan temple, worshipping the celestial gift as if it were bestowed upon them by the thunder-god Perun. Soon a large town, Kiev, rose up not far away. The soothsayers understood that this ""sky iron"" would protect their lands. Prince Svyatoslav Igorevich seized it from the soothsayers, and ordered a Black Mace forged from the iron. With this Black Mace, he won countless victories -- routed the Khazars and Bulgars, even threatened the all-powerful Romei of Byzantium. ^Nowadays there is a belief amongst the soldiers of the Prince, and the Cossack Starshinas, that he who holds the Black Mace shall have power for all the lands ""as nigh as a three month journey from the city of Kiev"". The soothsayers took their revenge on Prince Svyatoslav, as they once had on prince Oleg. They stole the mace while the prince was on one of his marches, and thereupon Svyatoslav died. The Black Mace fell into the hands of the princes of the house of Oleg. But thereafter its trail runs cold, and no one knows where it has landed."),
