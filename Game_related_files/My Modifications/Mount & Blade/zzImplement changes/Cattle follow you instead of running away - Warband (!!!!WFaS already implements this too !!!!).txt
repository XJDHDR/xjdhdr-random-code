module_game_menus.py:
Find the following block of code (lines 3592 - 3599 for me):
      ("cattle_drive_away",[],"Drive the cattle onward.",
       [
        (party_set_slot, "$g_encountered_party", slot_cattle_driven_by_player, 1),
        (party_set_ai_behavior, "$g_encountered_party", ai_bhvr_driven_by_party),
        (party_set_ai_object,"$g_encountered_party", "p_main_party"),
        (change_screen_return),
        ]
       ),
Change this line:
    (party_set_ai_behavior, "$g_encountered_party", ai_bhvr_driven_by_party),
to say this instead:
    (party_set_ai_behavior, "$g_encountered_party", ai_bhvr_escort_party),
