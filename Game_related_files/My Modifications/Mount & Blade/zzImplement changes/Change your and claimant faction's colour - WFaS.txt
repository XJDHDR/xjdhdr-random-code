module_dialogs.py:
Find the line (line 2008 for me) that says:
    (faction_set_color, "fac_player_supporters_faction", 0xAAAAAA),
The "0xAAAAAA" part defines the colour in hexidecimal notation taking the form: RRGGBB. 
This line defines the colour of the kingdom that is created when you rebel against your current lord.

Find the three lines (lines 3663, 16695 and 20042 for me) that say:
	(faction_set_color, "fac_player_supporters_faction", 0xFF0000)
The "0xFF0000" part defines the colour in hexidecimal notation taking the form: RRGGBB. 
These lines defines the colour of the kingdom that is created when you take up a claimant's cause.


module_scripts.py:
Find the two lines (lines 17467 and 27099 for me) that say:
	(faction_set_color, "fac_player_supporters_faction", 0xAAAAAA)
The "0xAAAAAA" part defines the colour in hexidecimal notation taking the form: RRGGBB. 
These lines defines the colour of the kingdom that is created when you rebel against your current lord.


In all cases, you may use tools such as this one to help you define your chosen colour in these scripts.
