module_mission_templates.py:
Find the code blocks that start with this (lines 2961 - 2964 for me):
  (
    "castle_attack_walls_belfry",mtf_battle_mode|mtf_synch_inventory,-1,
    "You attack the walls of the castle...",
    [
and this (lines 3042 - 3045 for me):
  (
    "castle_attack_walls_ladder",mtf_battle_mode|mtf_synch_inventory,-1,
    "You attack the walls of the castle...",
    [
and in each case, delete or comment out this line (lines 3034 and 3081 for me):
      common_inventory_not_available,
