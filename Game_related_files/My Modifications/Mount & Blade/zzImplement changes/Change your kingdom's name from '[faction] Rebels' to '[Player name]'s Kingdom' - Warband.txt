Change this line (line 5772 for me):
            (faction_set_name, "fac_player_supporters_faction", "@{s1} Rebels"),
to say this:
            (faction_set_name, "fac_player_supporters_faction", "@{playername}'s Kingdom"),
This line sets the name of the kingdom that is created when you take up a claimant's cause.
