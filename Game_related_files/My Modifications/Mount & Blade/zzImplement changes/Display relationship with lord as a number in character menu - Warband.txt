module_strings.py:
Find the following line (line 2673 for me):
    ("lord_info_string", "{reg6?:{reg4?{s54} is the ruler of {s56}.^:{s54} is a vassal of {s55} of {s56}.^}}Renown: {reg5}. Controversy: {reg15}.^{reg9?{reg3?She:He} is the {reg3?lady:lord} of {s58}.:{reg3?She:He} has no fiefs.}{s59}^{s49}"),
Change it to say:
    ("lord_info_string", "{reg6?:{reg4?{s54} is the ruler of {s56}.^:{s54} is a vassal of {s55} of {s56}.^}}Renown: {reg5}. Controversy: {reg15}.^Relation: {reg0} ({s59}).^{reg9?{reg3?She:He} is the {reg3?lady:lord} of {s58}.:{reg3?She:He} has no fiefs.}^{s49}"),
